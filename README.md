# Deploy WordPress with MariaDB in Kubernetes Cluster.

Provision infrastructure in AWS and deploy WordPress with MariaDB in Kubernetes Cluster using Helm charts.

----

# Getting Started

There are six sections to follow and implement as shown below:
- Provision AWS Infrastructure

- Set up Kubernetes cluster and NFS srver

- Create Dynamic Persistent Volume Provisioner

- Install Wordpress and MariaDB with Helm charts

- Connect to Wordpress and MariaDB

- Testing Data Persistence

- Securing Traffic with Let's Encrypt Certificates

- Enable WordPress monitoring metrics

-----

## Provision AWS Infrastructure

Clone this repo to local machine

```bash
cd /
git clone git@github.com:odennav/wordpress-mariadb-helm.git
cd terraform-kubernetes-aws-ec2/terraform-manifest
```

**Provision AWS resources**

Execute these terraform commands sequentially on your `local` machine to create the AWS infrastructure.

```bash
cd terraform-manifest
```

Initialize the terraform working directory

```bash
terraform init
```

Validate the syntax of the terraform configuration files

```bash
terraform validate
```

Create an execution plan that describes the changes terraform will make to the infrastructure.

```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the changes described in execution plan
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
Check AWS console for instances created and running


**SSH Access**

Use .pem key from AWS to SSH into the public EC2 instance.

IPv4 address of public EC2 instance will be shown in terraform outputs.


```bash
ssh -i private-key/terraform-key.pem ec2-user@<ipaddress>
```
Its possible to use public `EC2` instance as a jumpbox to securely SSH into private EC2 instances within the VPC.

Change password of root user for public EC2instance `control-dev`

```bash
sudo passwd
   ```
Switch to root user

Update `apt` package manager
```bash
cd /
apt update -y
apt upgrade -y
```

Confirm Git was installed 
```bash
git --version
```

Confirm `terraform-key` was transferred to public `EC2` instance by null provisioner

Please note if `.pem` key not found, copy it manually.

Also key can be copied to another folder because it will be deleted if node is restarted or shutdown
```bash
ls -la /tmp/terraform-key.pem
cp /tmp/terraform-key.pem /
```

Change permissions of `terraform-key.pem` file

```bash
chmod 400 /tmp/terraform-key.pem
```


Clone this repo to `/` directory in `dev-Control` node
   ```bash
   cd /
   git clone git@github.com:odennav/terraform-kubernetes-aws-ec2.git
   ```


-----

## Set up Kubernetes Cluster and NFS Server

Install Ansible in `dev-Control` node

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible
```

**Bootstrap EC2 Private Instances**
   
All the nodes need to be bootstrapped.

Once the bootstrap is complete, you will only be able to log in as `odennav-admin`.

Confirm SSH access to `k8snode-1`   
```bash
ssh -i /tmp/terraform-key.pem  odennav-admin@<k8snode-1 ipv4 address>
```  
To return to `dev-Control`, type `exit` and press `Enter` or use `Ctrl+D`.
   
Confirm SSH access to `k8snode-2`
```bash
ssh -i /tmp/terraform-key.pem  odennav-admin@<k8snode-2 ipv4 address>
```  
  
Confirm SSH access to `k8snode-3`
```bash
ssh -i /tmp/terraform-key.pem odennav-admin@<k8snode-3 ipv4 address>
```

Now you can now bootstrap them
```bash
cd ../bootstrap
ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml --limit k8s_master,k8s_node
```

**Set up Kubernetes Cluster**

Your kube nodes are now ready to have a Kubernetes cluster installed on them.

Execute playbooks in this particular order:

```bash
cd ../k8s
ansible-playbook k8s.yml  --limit k8s_master
ansible-playbook k8s.yml  --limit k8s_node
```

Check status of your nodes and confirm they're ready
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```


**Bootstrap the NFS Server**
   
Bootstrap this server.

Once the bootstrap is complete you will only be able to log in as `odennav-admin`

```bash
cd ../ansible/bootstrap
ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml --limit nfs_server
```

Create NFS share

```bash
cd ../nfs
ansible-playbook nfs.yml
```

`/pv-share/` directory is created and made available to all nodes, but its not mounted yet by the nodes
   
   
Login to 1st node in cluster

```bash
ssh -i /tmp/terraform-key.pem odennav-admin@<k8snode-1 ipv4 address>
```

Confirm nfs client is installed 
```bash
dpkg -l | grep nfs-common
```

If not available:
```bash
sudo apt install nfs-common
```

Create shared directory and mount nfs share

This directory will be mounted to `/pv-share/` created in NFS server.

```bash
cd /
sudo mkdir /shared
sudo chmod 2770 /shared
sudo mount -t nfs <db-1 ipv4 address>:/pv-share /shared
```

Confirm NFS share is implemented

Make a test file in `/shared/` dir on the cluster node. It should be present in `/pv-share/` dir on nfsserver.

```bash
sudo touch test-k8smaster
```

Repeat process for the other kubernetes cluster nodes.

-----

## Create Dynamic Persistent Volume Provisioner

Persistent storage is required to store very important data and avoiding total loss of data.

Kubernetes deals with pods that have short life span, they could be stopped at any time and restarted on a different node, causing the container's filesystem to be lost with the pod.

This is not reliable, hence the need for filesystem that is available and accessibleirrespective of pod actions.

PV is configured to use different types of storage technology such as:

- CephFS
- iSCSI
- NFS
- Azure File

We will use Network File System (NFS) which is a way of sharing a centralised filesystem across multiple nodes. 

Although persistent storage is managed by kubernetes in the cluster, the actual storage is on nfs server which is not part of the kubernetes cluster and it is on different subnet.

![](https://github.com/odennav/wordpress-mariadb-helm/blob/main/docs/1.png)

### Persistent Volume

Creating a PV within your cluster, tells Kubernetes that pods should have access to persistent storage that will outlive the pod and possibly the cluster itself.


### Persistent Volume Claims

We want pods to access the PV created. To do this, a Persistent Volume Claim or PVC is required. 

When PVC is created within a namespace, only pods in that namespace can mount it. However, it can be bound to any PV as these are not namespaced.

It is possible that Kubernetes cannot bind the PVC to a valid PV and that the PVC remains unbound until a PV becomes available.

This will lead to instances of pods in `Pending` state instead of `Running` state and PVC having `Unbound` status.

### Mounting PVC

Here access to PVC in the pod is done by mounting the storage as a volume within the container.

Once PVC is mounted by the pod, the application within the Podâ€™s container(s) now have access to the persistent storage.

Upon reschedule of pod(s), it will be reconnected to the same PV and will have access to the data it was using before it died, even if this is on another node.


Login to `k8smaster` and Confirm `Helm` is installed

Helm is an effective package manager for kubernetes

```bash
helm version
```

If not installed
```bash
sudo snap install helm --classic
```


Confirm persistent volume provisioner installed
   
```bash
kubectl get all -n nfs-provisioner
kubectl get sc -n nfs-provisioner
```
This should show dynamic provisioner setup and ready.

If `PV provisioner` not installed, do it manually:

```bash
helm repo add nfs-subdir-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner
helm install -n nfs-provsioner --create-namespace nfs-subdir-external-provisioner nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner --set nfs.server=<db-1 ipv4 address> --set nfs.path=/pv-share
```


**Setup PVC for Wordpress**
   
Our PV provisioner installed will dynamically provision PVs when PVCs are created.

We'll use kubens to switch between kubernetes namespaces.

```bash
sudo snap install kubectx --classic
kubens --version
```

Create wordpress namespace

Assuming you've `kubectl` installed along with kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl create namespace wordpress
kubens wordpress
```

Create PVC request on k8smaster

```bash
kubectl create -f wp-pvc.yaml
```



**Configure Wordpress Parameters**
   
Match this parameters and replace the values, so we have an account to access Wordpress

- *wordpressUsername*
   
- *wordpressPassword*
   
- *wordpressEmail*
   
- *wordpressFirstName*
   
- *wordpressLastName*
   
- *wordpressBlogName*

- *wordpressScheme*


```bash
sed -i '/wordpressUsername: user/wordpressUsername: odennav/' values.yaml
sed -i '/wordpressPassword: ""/wordpressPassword: odennav/' values.yaml
sed -i '/wordpressEmail: user@example.com/wordpressEmail: contact@odennav.com/' values.yaml
sed -i '/wordpressFirstName: FirstName/wordpressFirstName: odennav/' values.yaml
sed -i '/wordpressLastName: LastName/wordpressLastName: odennav/' values.yaml
sed -i '/wordpressBlogName: User's Blog!/wordpressBlogName: The Odennav Blog!/' values.yaml
sed -i '/wordpressScheme: http/wordpressScheme: https/' values.yaml
```


**Configure Persistence and Database Parameters**

Enable persistence using persistence volume claims and peristence volume access modes.

Match and replace values for persistence and database parameters below:

- *persistence.storageClass*
   
- *persistence.existingClaim*
   
- *mariadb.primary.persistence.storageClass*
   
- *mariadb.auth.username*
   
- *mariadb.auth.password*

```bash
sed -i '/persistence:/,/volumePermissions:/ {/storageClass: ""/s/""/nfs-client}' values.yaml
sed -i '/persistence:/,/volumePermissions:/ {/existingClaim: ""/s/""/pvc-wordpress}' values.yaml   
sed -i '/mariadb:/,/externalDatabase:/ {/storageClass: ""/s/""/nfs-client}' values.yaml
sed -i '/mariadb:/,/externalDatabase:/ {/username: bn_wordpress/s/bn_wordpress/odennav_wordpress}' values.yaml
sed -i '/mariadb:/,/externalDatabase:/ {/password: ""/s/""/odennav}' values.yaml
```

**Configure PVC Access Modes**
   
To access the `/admin` portal and enable WordPress scalability, a `ReadWriteMany` Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is required.

      
- *persistence.accessModes*
      
- *persistence.accessMode*

```bash
sed -i 's/ReadWriteOnce/ReadWriteMany/g' values.yaml
```

**Configure Replica Count**

Number of Wordpress replicas to deploy
   
- *replicaCount*

```bash
sed -i '/replicaCount: 1/replicaCount: 3/' values.yaml
```

**Configure Auto Scaling**
   
Enable horizontal scalability of pod resources for Wordpress when traffic load is increased

- *autoscaling.enabled*

```bash
sed -i '/autoscaling:/,/metrics:/ {/enabled: false/s/"false"/true}' values.yaml
```

**Configure htaccess**
   
For performance and security reasons, configure Apache with AllowOverride None and prohibit overriding directives with htaccess files
   

- *allowOverrideNone*

```bash
sed -i '/allowOverrideNone: false/allowOverrideNone: true/' values.yaml
```

-----

## Install Wordpress and MariaDB with Helm chart

**Install Wordpress and MariaDB**

   Use Helm charts to bootstrap wordpress and mariadb deployment on kubernetes cluster.

```bash
helm repo update
```

Install the chart with release-name,`my-wordpress`

```bash
helm install -f values.yml my-wordpress oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/wordpress
```

After installation, instructions will be printed to stdout.


**Add Wordpress Secrets**
   
We'll add wordpress credentials as a kubernetes secret.

From stdout above, Export the wordpress password to environment variable, `WORDPRESS_PASSWORD`

```bash
export WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace wordpress my-wordpress -o jsonpath="{.data.wordpress-password}" | base64 -d)
```

Then create secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
   --from-literal=username=wordpress \
   --from-literal=password=$WORDPRESS_PASSWORD
```

Delete environment variable, to prevent non-admin users viewing it's value.

```bash
unset WORDPRESS_PASSWORD
```

-----

## Connect to Wordpress and MariaDB

**Confirm PVCs are bound**

This confirms the applications installed will have access to persistent storage

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n wordpress
```


Check service created

```bash
kubectl get svc -n wordpress
```


HTTP access to Wordpress pods 

Export IPv4 address and port

```bash
export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace wordpress -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services my-wordpress)
export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace wordpress -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
echo "WordPress URL: http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/"
echo "WordPress Admin URL: http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/admin"
```

HTTP request to Wordpress site
```bash
curl http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/
```


Set up a port forward from the Service to the host on the master node.

```bash
kubectl port-forward â€” namespace wordpress
```

Set up a port forward from the host machine to the development machine.

```bash
ssh -L 54321:localhost:5432 k8snode-1@<k8snode-1 ipv4-address> -i /tmp/terraform-key.pem
```

----

## Test Data Persistence

Check pods running
   
Confirm mariadb pods are in 'Ready' state

```bash
kubectl get pods -n wordpress
```

Delete pods

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod name> -n wordpress
```

Restart port forwards
```bash
kubectl port-forward â€” namespace wordpress
ssh -L 54321:localhost:5432 k8snode-1@<k8snode-1 ipv4-address> -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Upon deletion of pod, another instance is automatically scheduled.

You'll still be able to access your database with data still intact.

## Secure Traffic with Let's Encrypt Certificates

The Bitnami WordPress Helm chart includes native support for Ingress routes and certificate management via cert-manager. This simplifies TLS configuration by enabling the use of certificates from various providers, such as Let's Encrypt.

### Install the Nginx Ingress Controller with Helm

Create namespace for ingress controller
Then switch to ingress-nginx namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx
kubens ingress-nginx
```

Pull the chart sources:

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-ingress --untar --version 1.2.0
```

Change working directory to nginx-ingress:

```bash
cd nginx-ingress
```

Upgrade the CRDs:

```bash
kubectl apply -f crds/
```

Install the chart with the release name, ingress-nginx

```bash
helm install ingress-nginx .
```

Next, check if the Helm installation was successful by running command below:

```bash
helm ls -n ingress-nginx
```


### Configure DNS for Nginx Ingress Controller

Configure `DNS` with a `domain` that you own and create the domain `A` record for the wordpress site.

Next, you will add the required `A` record for the wordpress application.

Please note, you need to identify the load balancer `external IP` created by the `nginx` deployment:


```bash
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
```

### Install Cert-Manager

First, add the `jetstack` Helm repo, and list the available charts:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

helm repo update jetstack
```

Next, install Cert-Manager using Helm:

```bash
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --version 1.8.0 \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

Finally, check if Cert-Manager installation was successful by running below command:

```bash
helm ls -n cert-manager
```

The output looks similar to `STATUS` column should print `deployed`:

```text
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
cert-manager    cert-manager    1               2024-04-08 18:02:08.124264 +0300 EEST   deployed        cert-manager-v1.15.0     v1.15.0
```


### Configure Production Ready TLS Certificates for WordPress

A cluster issuer is required first, in order to obtain the final TLS certificate. Open and inspect the `cluster-manifest/letsencrypt-issuer-values.yaml` file provided in this repository:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  namespace: wordpress
spec:
  acme:
    # You must replace this email address with your own.
    # Let's Encrypt will use this to contact you about expiring
    # certificates, and issues related to your account.
    email:  odennav@gmail.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Secret resource used to store the account's private key.
      name: prod-issuer-account-key
    # Add a single challenge solver for Cloudflare
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          cloudflare:
            email: odennav@gmail.com
            apiTokenSecretRef:
              name: cloudflare-token-secret
              key: cloudflare-token
        selector:
          dnsZones:
            - <YOUR DOMAIN>  # odennav.com
```

Apply via kubectl:

```bash
cd wordpress-mariadb-helm/
kubectl apply -f cluster-manifest/letsencrypt-issuer-values.yaml
```

Create a certificate for the `wordpress` namespace
```bash
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: local-odennav-com
  namespace: wordpress
spec:
  secretName: local-odennav-com-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: prod-issuer-acount-key
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  commonName: "*.odennav.com"
  dnsNames:
  - "<YOUR DOMAIN>"      # odennav.com
  - "*.<YOUR DOMAIN>"    # *.odennav.com
```

To secure WordPress traffic, open the helm `values.yaml` file in the `cluster-manifest` directory and add the following:

```yaml
# Enable ingress record generation for WordPress
ingress:
  enabled: true
  certManager: true
  tls:
    secretName: local-odennav-com-tls
  hostname: <YOUR_WORDPRESS_DOMAIN_HERE>
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
  extraTls:
  - hosts:
      - <YOUR_WORDPRESS_DOMAIN_HERE>
```

Upgrade via `helm`:

```bash
helm upgrade wordpress bitnami/wordpress \
    --namespace wordpress \
    --version 22.0.0 \
    --timeout 10m0s \
    --values /wordpress-mariadb-helm/cluster-manifest/values.yaml
```

This automatically creates a certificate through cert-manager. You can then verify that you've successfully obtained the certificate by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get certificate -n wordpress wordpress.local-tls
```

If successful, the output's READY column reads True:

```text
NAME                  READY   SECRET                AGE
wordpress.local-tls   True    wordpress.local-tls   24h
```

Now, you can access WordPress using the domain configured earlier. You will be guided through the `installation` process.

## Enable WordPress Monitoring Metrics

In this section, you will learn how to enable metrics for monitoring your WordPress instance.

First, open the `wordpress-values.yaml` created earlier in this tutorial, and set `metrics.enabled` field to `true`:

```yaml
# Prometheus Exporter / Metrics configuration
metrics:
  enabled: true
```

Apply changes using Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade wordpress bitnami/wordpress \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace wordpress \
    --version 22.0.0 \
    --timeout 10m0s \
    --values /wordpress-mariadb-helm/cluster-manifest/values.yaml
```

Next, port-forward the wordpress service to inspect the available metrics:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace wordpress svc/wordpress-metrics 9150:9150
```

Now, open a web browser and navigate to [localhost:9150/metrics](http://127.0.0.1:9150/metrics), to see all WordPress metrics.

Finally, you need to configure Grafana and Prometheus to visualise metrics exposed by your new WordPress instance.

### Enhancing Wordpress Performance

Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a straightforward method to accelerate a WordPress website. 

A CDN consists of servers strategically positioned to optimize the delivery of media files, thereby enhancing the loading speed of web pages. 

Many websites encounter latency issues when their visitors are located far from the server location. 

By utilizing a CDN, content delivery can be expedited by relieving the web server of the task of serving static content such as images, CSS, JavaScript, and video streams. 

Additionally, caching static content minimizes latency. Overall, CDN serves as a dependable and effective solution for optimizing websites and enhancing the global user experience.


### Configuring Cloudflare

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) is a renowned provider of content delivery network (CDN), DNS, DDoS protection, and security services. Leveraging Cloudflare can significantly accelerate and bolster the security of your WordPress site, making it an excellent solution for website optimization and protection.

Cloudflare account is required for this configuration. Visit the [Cloudflare website](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) and signup for a free account.

Below are the steps to configure Cloudflare for your WordPress site:

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard using your account credentials and click on the `+ Add Site` button.

2. Enter your WordPress site's domain and click `Add Site`.

3. Choose the `Free` plan and click `Get Started`.

4. From `Review DNS records` and click `Add record`. Add an `A` record with your desired name and the `IPv4 address` of your cloud provider load balancer. Click `Continue`.

5. Follow instructions to change your domain registrar's nameservers to Cloudflare's nameservers.

6. After updating nameservers, click `Done, check nameservers`.

7. Cloudflare may offer configuration recommendations; you can skip these for now by clicking `Skip recommendations`.

An email will confirm when your site is active on Cloudflare.
Use the Analytics page in your Cloudflare account to monitor web traffic on your WordPress site.

###  Remove Wordpress and MariaDB
   If you're taking the option to remove both applications, implement the following:

**Delete PVC**
   
This removes and unbounds PVC from PV.

```bash
kubectl delete -f pg-pvc.yml 
```

**Delete Namespaces**

```bash
kubectl delete ns wordpress
kubectl delete ns ingress-nginx
```

**Destroy AWS resources**

From your local machine:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
